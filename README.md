CS474_HW2_Spring2022_Prajwal Athreya Jagadish : Adding class construct that support limited inheritance

Building up on the homework 1 , where we created a domian specific language for the users of set theory , in this homework (HW2),I have added a class construct that supports limited inheritance.

#Documentation for my language ScalaSet written in Scala language version 3.1 and using sbt(scala build tool).

ScalaSet can be used by the users to implement binary set operations like Union,Intersection,Difference ,Symmetric Difference and Cartesian product of Sets. My main source code file is named as homework1_PAJ and is in the package named prajwal.The test cases are under the file test and named homework1_PAJtest.

package prajwal should be imported to run the program and implement binary operation on sets.

Binary Operations that can be performed on sets by the user:

The different binary operations that can be performed on sets by the users are :

a)setUnion : Uses union Operation where the user can implement the union of two sets.

b)setInterction : Uses intersect Operation where the user can implement the intersection of two sets.

c)setDifference : Uses diff operation where the user can implement the difference of two sets.

d)setSymmetricDifference : Since there is no standard operation for setSymmetricDifference,we can create an operation using operators diff and union.That is setSymmetricDifference will be :

                       (set1.diff(set2)).union(set2.diff(set1))
e)setCartesianProduct : Similar to the setSymmetricDifference ,there is no standard operator to implement the cartesian product of two sets and hence we have created an operation using flatMap() method. We know that cartesian product of two sets is given as :

                    set1 X set2 = {(a,b) : a € set1 , b € set2 }
                    
                    So when we use flatMap() method,it will take the predicate and applies it to each element of the collection and the returns the new
                    collection.In our case flatMap() method will take the element from set1(element belonging to set 1 (a)) and set2 (element belonging to 
                    set2(b)) and then returns a new set with these elements which is the cartesian product of the two sets.
                    
f)ourClass: for users to create new class.
g)ourInstanceVariable: for instance variables inside the class.
h)ourMethod : for users to ceate a new method inside the class.
i)ourConstructor : for users to create constructor.
j)newObject : for users to create a new object.
k)invokeMethod : for users to invoke the method that they have created.

Also there are other opeations that can be performed with sets and they are :

a)newSet : In this language, newSet can be used to create a new set and populate the elements to that set.In the newSet I have used (args:Any*) so that our set can take any number of elements. And the syntax to print the new can be something like the following :

       println(newSet("Your set name",1,2,3)) or
       
       println(newSet("Your set name","string1","string2","string3")) and hence like this any set can be created with newSet in scalaSet language.
b)setInsert : Another feature is to insert elements by the user after the set is already created.Say if the user wants to insert a few elements to the set that was created ,the the user can use setInsert in order to insert more elements to the already existing set.And the syntax for this feature is as follows :

          Assign("the set name in which you want to insert elements",setInsert("the set name in which you want to insert elements",1,2,3,4)).eval()
c)setDelete :Similar to the setInsert feature we also have a setDelete feature which deletes the elements from an existing set.If the user wants to delete certain elements from an existing set then the user can use setDelete in order to delete the elements from an existing set.And the syntax for this feature is as follows :

         Assign("the set name in which you want to delete elements",setDelete("the set name in which you want to delete elements",1,2,3,4)).eval()
d)Assign : Assign operation can be used to locate any set and also to use any other features like setUnion,setIntersection,setDifference,newSet and other operations as well.Assign operation can be used in the main method and the syntax is as follows :

       Assign("name of the set",setOperation_to_be_performed("name of the set",e,l,e,m,e,n,t,s)).eval()
->Project file name is homework and homework1_PAJ is the main file in src and homework1_PAJ in test is the test file with testcases. in build.sbt file I added the libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.2.10" % "test"
